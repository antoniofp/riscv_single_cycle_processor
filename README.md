# RISC-V Single Cycle Processor

A 32-bit single-cycle RISC-V processor implementation supporting a subset of the RV32I instruction set.

## Overview

This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor in Verilog, based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. The design follows the principles described in "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by Sarah L. Harris and David Harris.

### Implementation Details

- Single-cycle execution (one instruction per clock cycle)
- 32-bit data path
- Separate instruction and data memories
- Basic control unit
- ALU supporting all necessary operations
